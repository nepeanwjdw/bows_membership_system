# bows_membership_system
Design and Build a RESTful API membership card system
## Designs
The below design shows use cases for this system. Before a user can perform any tasks, they must first register their card. Registered users can top up their cards, login and logout. The system will be used to view and purchase goods, however that is outside the scope of this project.
